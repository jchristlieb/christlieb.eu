# Contributing

Contributions are **welcome** and will be fully **credited**. I accept contributions via Pull Requests on [Github](https://github.com/bambamboole/christlieb.eu).

## Pull Requests

- **[PSR-2 Coding Standard.](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md)** The easiest way to apply the conventions is to install [PHP CS Fixer](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer).
- **Add tests!** Your patch won't be accepted if it doesn't have tests.
- **Document any change in behaviour.** Make sure the `README.md` is kept up-to-date.
- **One pull request per feature.** If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.

*Happy coding!*
